{% include user_def %}

I'm a Ph.D. student majored in Machine Learning @ Georgia Institute of Technology.
I'm advised by [Dr. Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org/) and [Dr. Le Song](https://www.linkedin.com/in/le-song-03223813/) on weakly supervised information extraction methods for natural language processing.
I'm also working on information extraction from Material Science articles.
