**[My CV]({{base_path}}/files/CV-Yinghao.Li.pdf)**

I'm a Ph.D. student majored in Machine Learning @ Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Dr. Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org/) and [Dr. Le Song](https://www.linkedin.com/in/le-song-03223813/).

My research interest covers
- **Information Extraction**
  - Effective and efficient way of fine-tuning and using large language models to retrieve structured information from free-formed documents;
  - Using LLMs as pseudo dataset generator to supervise the training of smaller task-specific labelers, such as BERT;
  - Weakly-supervised named entity recognision and text classificatio with multiple noisy labeling functions [[Conditional Hidden Markov Model (CHMM). 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12848), [Sparse CHMM. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14228), [Wrench. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11377), [Ren et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04582)];
  - HTML information extraction through Transformer-based DOM node classifier [[TrENC. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14549)];
  - Rule-based molecular property extractor [[post]({{base_path}}/posts/2023/07/material-ie/), [Toland et al. 2023](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpca.3c05870#)].

- **LLM Reasoning**
  - Investigating the source of reasoning ability of LLM: is it intrinsic or a simple mimic of training data? [[Minesweeper. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07387)].

- **Uncertainty Estimation**
  - Benchmarking the uncertainty quantification methods for large modecular representation models on molecular property prediction [[MUBen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10060)].

- **Text Generation**
  - Generate paraphrases under the syntactic guidance of constituency parsing tags [[Li et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01737)].


I got my Master degree from Georgia Tech, School of ECE, where I worked with [Prof. Ying Zhang](https://zhang.ece.gatech.edu/) on Radar SCG signal processing and understanding [[Li et al. 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920010), [Xia et al. 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9143413)].
